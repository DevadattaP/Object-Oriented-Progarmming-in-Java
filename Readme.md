# Object-Oriented Programming in Java (Semester 3 - Computer Science Engineering, AI & ML)

This repository contains a collection of practical programs implemented as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPM) course (Semester 3) in the Computer Science Engineering (AI & ML) curriculum at the University of Mumbai. The programs are written in Java and cover various fundamental and advanced OOP concepts.

## Introduction

This repository showcases a variety of Java programs that illustrate key OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, exception handling, threading, and GUI development using Swing and AWT. The programs were designed to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical implementation.

## Programs Included

The repository contains the following programs:

1. **Basic Programs**: Armstrong number, largest of 3 numbers, leap year check, triangle pattern.
2. **Number Operations**: Average of 5 numbers, even-odd check, factorial calculation.
3. **Class-based Programs**: Circle operations (radius, area, perimeter) and student profile management.
4. **Constructor Usage**:
   - Area of rectangle and circle.
   - Box dimensions setting (length, breadth, height).
5. **User-Defined Packages**: Implementation and usage of custom Java packages.
6. **String and Array Manipulation**:
   - String operations: Decimal to binary conversion, string suffix check, character counting.
   - Array operations: Diagonal sum calculation.
7. **Dynamic Data and String Manipulation**: Using `Vector` for dynamic storage, and `StringBuffer` for string operations.
8. **Inheritance**: Single, multiple, and hierarchical inheritance demonstrations.
9. **Abstract Class**: Implementation and usage of abstract classes.
10. **Interfaces**: Creation and implementation of interfaces.
11. **Exception Handling**: Handling various exceptions in Java.
12. **User-Defined Exceptions**: Creation and handling of custom exceptions.
13. **Threading**: Multithreading concepts and implementations.
14. **Applet and AWT**: Creating applets and using Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) for GUI.
15. **Swing-based Calculator**: Development of a simple calculator using Java Swing.

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you'll need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Java programming and object-oriented concepts.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans is recommended for easier development and testing.
- For running applet, you need older version of java (e.g. jre-8u341)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DevadattaP/Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java.git
   cd Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java
   ```
2. **Open the Project in an IDE:**
- Open your preferred Java IDE.
- Import the cloned repository as a Java project.

3. **Compile and Run:**
- Navigate to the program you wish to run.
- Compile the program using the IDE's build functionality.
- Run the program within the IDE.

4. **Running GUI Programs:**
- For programs involving AWT, Applet, or Swing, ensure your IDE supports GUI components.
- Applets can be run using the appletviewer or by embedding them in an HTML file and viewing in a browser.

## Program Descriptions
1. Basic Programs
    - Armstrong Number: Checks if a number is an Armstrong number.
